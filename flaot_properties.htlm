        We started with a bunch of passionate techies in 2008, and now have grown into a family of 
        1500+ Newers, spread across our three locations - New Delhi, Dubai, and NYC, catering to over
         200 customers worldwide.
      In 2008, when the entire world was staring at one of the biggest depressions, we came into being.
       Our birth in the toughest of the times helped us in two ways - first, we had to be very cutting-edge
        with a clear differentiating factor, and second, we had to have very strong values and culture to 
        attract and retain top-notch talent.</p>
